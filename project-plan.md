# Project plan
## Introduction
The project is to create a CRUD REST-API that will handle books. In the end the user will be able to create, read, update and delete books from the server. The biggest constraint is time though the project should be done by the end of week 11, 2018. During this the project there will be deliveries of the progess of the project.

## Project organisation
The organisation is on one person that will do all of the required parts in the project.

## Resources
The project's main resource is one person working less than 50% effectivly since part of the time needs to be dedicated to lectures and learning new information. This is something that will effect the scheduling and planning of the activities.

## Risk analysis
|Risk                                                                                                           | Probability | Effects        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|
|Getting ill                                                                                                    |Low          | Serious         |
|The time required to plan is underestimated                                                                    |Modate       | Serious         |
|The time required to develop the software is underestimated                                                    |Modate       | Serious         |

### Avoidance strategies
By planning to be done with activities for the milestones and delivarables before the actual deadlines will help to avoid or at least minimize the impact of the risks.

## Activity Schedule

| ID |Activity                                           | Duration (Hours) | Depenencies | Milestone | Week  |
|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| T1 |Identify and realise use cases                     | 10               |             | M1        | 6     |
| T2 |Design logic to list books                         | 5                | T1          | M1        | 7     |
| T3 |Implement the design                               | 3                | T1, T2      | M1        | 7     |
| T4 |Create a test plan                                 | 10               | M1          | M2        | 8     |
| T5 |Create test cases                                  | 3                | M1, T4      | M2        | 8 - 9 |
| T6 |Unit tests                                         | 2                | M1, T4, T5  | M2        | 9     |
| T7 |API tests                                          | 2                | M1, T4, T5  | M2        | 9     |
| T8 |Iteration planning                                 | 15               | M2          | M3        | 10    |

Since this is a learning opportunity the last milestone will be done using a more agile approach.
