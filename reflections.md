#### Implement
Time log: 19:45, 30 January, 26:06 min.


#### Reflections
The planning was separated into two tasks. The first one was to list all of the steps to implement the feature and then trying to estimate the time for each task. The time estimates were added together and included some extra time for vagrant and eventual problems that might occur. The final estimate was quite close to the actual implementation time but some of the time estimations were too short while others were a bit long and the implementation was done in a bit of a rush. Next time I’ll add some extra time for each task just in case. Even though the steps are numbered I realised during the implementation that I needed to jump from 1 to 5, 6 and back into the right order to be able to see that the implementation was done correctly. For the next task, I need to order the steps better.

### Subtask B JSON

|1.     |Turn the array in `bookList` into a JSON Object.                                                                           | 5 min     |
|2.     |Turn the array in `bookList` into an Object.                                                                               | 2 min     |
|       |*Total estimated time*                                                                                                     | *15 min*  |


#### Implement
Time log: 12:40, 31 January, 2:43 min

#### Reflections
I followed the same structure to plan the task as I did on the first one. The only difference was that I included the reload time as well as the eventual mishaps in the time estimation for each step instead of having it as a separate time estimation. I felt fairly sure about how to turn the array into JSON there for the time estimation was quite low and most of the time was there to make sure that the reload time was not going to ruin the time estimation. Fortunately, everything went to plan and I managed to keep the time restriction.

### Improvement Strategies
By starting to make time estimates about both planning and reflection and not just the implementation I will both get more experience of time estimation and also better knowledge about how long the task actually takes rather than just the implementation.
It's a good thing to have longer time estimations in case of eventual problems. So far nothing to mayor have interupted the work but something unexpected might occur. Personally I'm quite time optimistic and I think it might be a good thing to at least double my initial time estimation.

### Subtask C ­­ Web

#### Planning
The implementation is quite straight forward there for neither the planing nor the implementation will take to long. The thing that probably take longest to do is the reflection. This task will problably in total take 1 hour to finish. 15 min planning, 15 min implementation and 30 min reflection. The table below is the planing of the whole task.

| Order | Subtask                                                                                                                   | Est. time |
|:-----:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------:|
|1.     |Planning                                                                                                                   | 15 min    |
|2.     |Call the callback function with the `bookList`.                                                                            | 3 min     |
|3.     |Make sure it works byecking the output on the site                                                                         | 3 min     |
|4.     |Write reflection                                                                                                           | 30 min    |
|       |*Total estimated time*                                                                                                     | *60 min*  |

#### Reflection
Both the implementation and the planning took shorter time than expected. In total it took 5:35 minutes to plan and implement the feature. This is probably a result of having a clear idea on how to solve the solution, some of the planning happened during the planing for the whole task and the minimum estimation is 15 minutes. Even though the time estimation was way off this seems to be an improvement strategi in the long run since a task is much more than just the implementation and it's important to be able to estimate the whole task from start to finish.
