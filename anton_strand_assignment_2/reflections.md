#### Reflection
I decided to make sure that I managed to do all the "shalls" before I did the "shoulds" therefore I will postpone the optional extra case document and activity until next iteration. I want to make sure that everything that needs to be included is done before I can continue with the optional tasks. The last time estimations have been way off after adding some extra contingency time to make sure that I manage to do everything within my given time frame. For this task, I decided to reduce the extra time a bit and try to get it closer to the actual time but with the risk of the time estimation would be tight. The estimation became a lot closer to the actual time spent.

#### Reflection
Due to the way I made my implementation, with a static JSON object containing an array of objects, the sequence diagram became a bit harder to do since there where nothing dynamically created and there for everything was made anonymously as well. The diagram looks a bit more as if the list were made in a sequence rather than as a static premade JSON object. But at the same time, it shows the essence of the things that are happening. The current implementation will be changed during the next iteration and the new implementation would probably make more sense as a sequence diagram. Otherwise, everything went smoothly and I manage to stick to the time estimation.
