By dividing the task into even smaller subtasks it becomes easier to both get an overview of what needs to be done and to estimate the time for each task based on my experience of doing similar tasks before. It also makes it easier to make sure that nothing will be forgotten in the implementation and the time estimation.# Project plan
## Introduction
The project is to create a CRUD REST-API that will handle books. In the end, the user will be able to create, read, update and delete books from the server. The biggest constraint is time through the project should be done by the end of week 11, 2018. During this the project, there will be deliveries of the progress of the project.

## Project organization
The organization is one person that will do all of the required parts of the project.

## Resources
The project's main resource is one person working less than 50% effectively since part of the time needs to be dedicated to lectures and learning new information. This is something that will affect the scheduling and planning of the activities.

## Risk analysis
|Risk                                                                                                           | Probability | Effects         |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|:----------------|
| Getting ill                                                                                                   | Low         | Serious         |
| The time required to plan is underestimated                                                                   | Moderate    | Serious         |
| The time required to develop the software is underestimated                                                   | Moderate    | Serious         |

### Avoidance strategies
By planning to be done with activities for the milestones and deliverables before the actual deadlines will help to avoid or at least minimize the impact of the risks.

Since this is a learning opportunity the last milestone will be done using a more agile approach with iterations and an iteration plan. The iteration plan is to early to write now.

## Monitoring and reporting mechanisms
For each milestone should also include a time log and reflection of the process. Additional documentation for the specific milestone is required.
