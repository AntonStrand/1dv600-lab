# Knowledge for theme 1
The following are a number of questions that you should be able to answer from this theme.

1. ## What is a software development process?

1. ## What different software process models are common?
    1. Incremental development
        * Kanban
        * Scrum
        * XP
    2. Unified process (Not sure where it fit)
    3. Rational Unified Process
    4. Waterfall (is a plan driven process)
    5. Integration and configuration
    6. Boehm’s spiral process model (Risk driven)

1. ## What are the general activites in the waterfall model?
    In theory each phase needs to be approved and signed off before starting on the next. But in reality, the line is not as sharp since the next phase often will show mistakes made in the phase before.

    1. __Requirements analysis and definition__ The system’s services, constraints, and goals are established by consultation with system users. They are then defined in detail and serve as a system specification.

    2. __System and software design__ The systems design process allocates the require- ments to either hardware or software systems. It establishes an overall system architecture. Software design involves identifying and describing the funda- mental software system abstractions and their relationships.

    3. __Implementation and unit testing__ During this stage, the software design is real- ized as a set of programs or program units. Unit testing involves verifying that each unit meets its specification.

    4. __Integration and system testing__ The individual program units or programs are integrated and tested as a complete system to ensure that the software requirements have been met. After testing, the software system is delivered to the customer.

    5. __Operation and maintenance__ Normally, this is the longest life-cycle phase. The system is installed and put into practical use. Maintenance involves correcting errors that were not discovered in earlier stages of the life cycle, improving the implementation of system units, and enhancing the system’s services as new requirements are discovered.

1. ## What is done during the different activities?
    See the answer above.

1. ## What is the difference between analysis and design?
    Analysis is about figuring out what and design is how.
