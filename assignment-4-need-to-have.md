# Vision document
About vision - Focus more on app information that has been provide. It can include app background, app features, stakeholders (users + developers) including their goals, app current status, all of your tasks(iterations) in brief.

### Ask yourself:
- Can the reader understand the purpose?
- Can the reader understand which problem(s) the software is trying to solve.
- Can the reader understand who the end user(s) are?

### Content
  1. Introduction
  2. Positioning
      1. Problem statement - Why is the system needed
      2. Product position statement - How the product will fix the problem (Purpose)
  3. Stakeholders
      - Name (type), Description, Responsability
  4. Product overview
    1. Needs and features - Very high level
        - Need, Priority, Feature, Planned release

# Project plan
About project plan - In general, project plan can start with intro, purpose, app req., stakeholders + their goals, resources, risks including mitigation, project goals (iteration 1,2,3,4). Then add section for each iteration and explain each iteration in detail such as its goals, milestones, req. covering, deliverables. 

### Ask yourself.
- Are milestones specified?
- Can the reader understand which activities will be done during each milestone.
- Does the milestone clearly state what is needed for the milestone to be fulfilled?
- Can the reader understand which resources you have available?
- Motivate the resources you have allocated to a milestone. 
- If you list risks, do not forget risk mitigation.
